                            A demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, 
                            from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging 
                            scenes, working in close coordination with his actors, crew, and other collaborators. He often asked for several 
                            dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting 
                            notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography.

                                    height of his career, on April 17, 1950, the day of a fight with middleweight Bobby James. The film 
                                    opens with a short section on boxing's history and then follows Cartier through his day as he 
                                    prepares for the 10 P.M. bout. Cartier eats breakfast in his West 12th Street apartment in 
                                    Greenwich Village, goes to early mass, and eats lunch at his favorite restaurant. At 4 P.M., 
                                    he starts preparations for the fight. By 8 P.M., he is waiting in his dressing room at Laurel 
                                    Gardens in Newark, New Jersey, for the fight to begin.

                                    The Seafarers is Stanley Kubrick's fourth film and third short documentary, made for the Seafarers 
                                    International Union, directed in June 1953. The film was Kubrick's first in color. There are shots of 
                                    ships, machinery, a canteen, and a union meeting. The film was supervised by the staff of The 
                                    Seafarers Log, the union magazine. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a long, 
                                    sideways-shooting dolly shot to establish the life of the seafarer's community; this shot is 
                                    an early demonstration of a signature technique that Kubrick would use in his feature films.

                                    Fear and Desire is a 1952 American anti-war film directed, produced, and edited by Stanley Kubrick, 
                                    and written by Howard Sackler. With a production team of only fifteen people, the film was Kubrick's 
                                    feature directorial debut. In the years following its release, Fear and Desire 
                                    seemed to have disappeared. Distributor Joseph Burstyn died in November 1953 on a trans-Atlantic 
                                    flight, and his company went out of business. Legend has it that Kubrick destroyed the film's 
                                    original negative and sought to do the same to any leftover prints after the failed film fell 
                                    out of circulation following Burstyn's death. However, some prints of the film remained in 
                                    private collections.

                                    Lolita is a 1962 psychological comedy-drama film directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on the 1955 novel
                                     of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov, who is also credited with writing the screenplay. The film follows 
                                     Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged literature lecturer who becomes sexually infatuated with Dolores Haze 
                                     (nicknamed "Lolita"), a young adolescent girl. Lolita polarized contemporary critics for its controversial 
                                     depictions of child sexual abuse. Years after its release, Kubrick expressed doubt that he would have 
                                     attempted to make the film had he fully understood how severe the censorship limitations on it would be.

                                    2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 epic science fiction film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. The film is noted for 
                                    its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight, pioneering special effects, and ambiguous 
                                    imagery. Kubrick avoided conventional cinematic and narrative techniques; dialogue is used sparingly, 
                                    and there are long sequences accompanied only by music. The soundtrack incorporates numerous works of 
                                    classical music, by composers including Richard Strauss, Johann Strauss II, Aram Khachaturian, 
                                    and György Ligeti.

                                    A Clockwork Orange is a 1971 dystopian crime film adapted, produced, and directed by 
                                    Stanley Kubrick, based on Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel of the same name. It employs disturbing, 
                                    violent images to comment on psychiatry, juvenile delinquency, youth gangs, and other social, 
                                    political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain. The film was met with polarised 
                                    reviews from critics and was controversial due to its depictions of graphic violence. After 
                                    it was cited as having inspired copycat acts of violence, the film was withdrawn from 
                                    British cinemas at Kubrick's behest, and it was also banned in several other countries.

                                    The film's cinematography has been described as ground-breaking. Especially notable are the long double 
                                    shots, usually ended with a slow backwards zoom, the scenes shot entirely in candlelight, and the
                                     settings based on William Hogarth paintings.

                                    from early twentieth-century Vienna to 1990s New York City. The plot centers on 
                                    a doctor (Tom Cruise) who is shocked when his wife (Nicole Kidman) reveals that 
                                    she had contemplated having an affair a year earlier. He then embarks on a 
                                    night-long adventure, during which he infiltrates a masked orgy of an unnamed 
                                    secret society.

                    A demanding perfectionist, Kubrick assumed control over most aspects of the filmmaking process, 
                    from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging 
                    scenes, working in close coordination with his actors, crew, and other collaborators. He often asked for several 
                    dozen retakes of the same shot in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting 
                    notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography.
